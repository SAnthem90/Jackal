# Jackal
## tele.py
By python tele.py file you can control the Jackal And Turtlebot with w,a,d and x keys (Original from Turtlebot3).
## inter.py
We have only two types of robot motion from twist. One as Translational and Rotational (Cylindrical System). So in this code I have converted cylindrical system to cartesian system for the twists we are getting, so that we can give input as X and Y (feets) to navigate our robot.
